    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This potato salad is amazing served just warmer than room temperature, allowed to sit
        in the fridge for 30 minutes before eating. An amazing BBQ side or work-lunch,
        this dish is protein-packed and savory.</p>
        <p>The red potato skin keeps its snap after boiling which allows the small creamer
        potatos to retain their shape and adds colour and interest to the dish as well.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <ul>

        <li>3 pounds red creamer potatoes cut into bite sized pieces, about 1-inch</li>
        <li>1 gallon water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar or rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 sweet onion, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 pound bacon cooked til crispy and crumbled or chopped.
        <li>Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon for garnish.</li>
        <li>6 green onions green parts only, thinly sliced. Reserve 1 teaspoon for garnish.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley chopped. Reserve 1 teaspoon for garnish.</li>
        <li>4 hard boiled eggs peeled, and sliced. Reserve 3 slices for garnish.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

       </ul>

       <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot high heat. Add 1/4 cup of salt to the water and stir to dissolve. Carefully add the potatoes to the water and return to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil the potatoes for between 8 and 15 minutes, depending on what size you cut them. Beginning at 8 minutes, use tongs to extract a piece of potato and test for doneness.
                Do this until they are tender and easily pierced with a fork, knife, toothpick, or skewer.</li>
            <li>Drain in a colander, then immediately return the potatoes to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add vinegar and diced sweet onion to the pan and toss to distribute. Put a tight fitting lid on the pan and refrigerate to bring the potatoes to body temperature.</li>
            <li>Stir in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, green onions, parsley, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and chopped, crispy bacon. Transfer to a serving bowl.</li>
            <li>You can either garnish with the remaining bacon, hard-boiled egg, parsley, and green onion and serve warm, or cover and refrigerate to chill.</li>
            <li>If you refrigerate it first, stir, and add a little extra mayonnaise if needed before garnishing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
