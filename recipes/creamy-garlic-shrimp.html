    <h1>Creamy Garlic Shrimp</h1>

    <img src="../images/creamy-shrimp.png" alt="A creamy shrimp dish in a cast iron skillet.">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This dish is creamy and indulgent, and is best served with pasta or warm bread to soak up the creamy garlic sauce.
        It is a personal favourite of mine when I am feeling tired and snacky.</p>
    
    <p>It reheats very well. Simply place on the stove over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes until shrimp is warmed through,
        or in the microwave. The sauce may have thickened up in the refrigerator, so add a little water to thin out the sauce
        a bit until you achieve a desired consistency.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
